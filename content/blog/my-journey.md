I am a software developer by accident, and I owe that accident to everyone but myself. Throughout my whole life, everyone around me has been bringing me up. For my first blog post, I want to share my journey on how I became a software developer.

### No real ambition

Back then, I didn't really have that big of a dream or ambition. I never saw myself taking up whatever career my teachers were suggesting to my schoolmates.

I was in **MRSM Taiping**, which is a science-oriented, fully boarding school. The suggestions of career paths there:

- Medical
- Chemical Engineering
- And all **real** engineering stuffs (calling it real engineering because they will get mad if I call software engineering, engineering).
- Mostly Science or Maths related career
- NOT Computer Science

So my ambition at the time was really doing gig work, freelance photographer and quick cash mentality. I was just playing games, building PCs during the Covid-19 quarantine, and hadn't figured out what I wanted to be yet. Turned out, that building PC was actually the spark that ignited my interest in software development, but I didn't know it at the time as I actually enjoy building stuffs and it worked and I am pretty sure everyone who build stuffs can relate to it.

This went on until I had to choose what my course would be in university or pre-university, because in Malaysia, you can't simply start with a Bachelor's degree after school.

### The Diploma: My Second Choice, My Unexpected Opportunity

Long story short, I did not get what I wanted, which was Foundation in Physical Science in University Malaya, because, well, I'm not the brightest student ever in the first place.

I got **Diploma in Computer Science**, which was my second choice. I felt really high pressure at the time because, you know, Asian culture, where we compare education to everyone.

Most of my friends were:

- Taking foundation to prepare to go overseas.
- Taking prerequisites to go to top 5 universities in Malaysia.
- Getting scholarships here and there, and so on.

Me? I was just going to the local uni diploma.

### The Internship Rejection Marathon

When the internship phase came, I couldn't find any placement. Apparently, no company wanted me. LOL.

Except for one: **[Recogine Technology Sdn. Bhd.](https://recogine.com)**

They gave me my first opportunity, under my great manager, **Mr. Lew**, and also my lead engineer, **Edmund**. And the rest is history.

### My Deepest Gratitude

Looking back at my path, everyone around me helped me a lot my family, my friends, bosses, colleagues and to my loving partner.

Without them, I am truly nothing. Like, genuinely, I'm no one. I don't even know, and I don't want to know, what I will be doing without them.

> **Thank you to everyone who saw potential in me when I didn't see it in myself.**

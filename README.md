This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
# or
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Package Manager

This project is configured to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the preferred package manager. The repository includes:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Lockfile for reproducible installs
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Workspace configuration
- `package.json` with `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.13.1"`

### Common pnpm commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
